# Project description

### Forecasting Growth Scores for GitHub Repositories Using Machine Learning

This project involves building a web-based application that predicts the growth score of a GitHub repository over a specified time period. This growth score is derived from metrics like stars, forks, pull requests, and open issues. The application utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with attention mechanism to make accurate predictions based on time-series data.


# File System description
- __src__: 
  -  `functions.py` has all the necessary functions that make the app work 
  -  `app.py` is the main app file
  -  `test.py` was mainly used for experimentation
- __notebooks__: 
  - `main.ipynb` where the bulk of exploration work took place, and where the RNN model, scaling and PCA models have been generated
  - `generate_data.ipynb` this is the file which was used to get, merge, and augment the data from the various Github repositories
  - `manual_test.ipynb` is the file that tests the model forecasting capability on a single repositories
- __models__: holds the different RNN model, trainging and testing scaling model and input data PCA models
- __data__: holds the main CSV file `github_data.csv` generated by the `generate_data.ipynb` file
- __docs__: holds the initial project proposal, and project links
- __scrap_files__ contains different notebooks that were used for experimentation and proof of concepts
- __requirements.txt__ lists all the various Python packages that was used for this project

# Running the notebooks on your local
- create a `config.py` file in the root directory and insert your Github Access Token in the form of `GITHUB_TOKEN = 'you_access_token'`
- install all the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`


# Enabling the app on your local
1. Fork and pull this repo to your local
2. cd `data-science-course-final-project`
3. make sure to install all the packages in the requirement.txt app
4. Generate a new Github Access Token and save the token localy under `~/.streamlit/secrets.toml` in the form of `GITHUB_TOKEN = 'you_access_token'` (you may need to create the `secrets.toml` file)
5. run `python3 -m streamlit run ./src/app.py` this will open the app in the browser on http://localhost:8501/
