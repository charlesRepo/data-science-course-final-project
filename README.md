### Criteria for a Predictive Model
1. You must gather data yourself using web scraping or some API. Existing datasets may be accepted but it will be at the discretion of your project mentor.
2. Your model must be deployed. Meaning that it is not a static notebook, but has a server component.
3. Your model must be trained and saved. In your final presentation, you should be able to present your model with new data.
4. The following predictive models will NOT be accepted:
     - Stock prediction models
     - Housing price prediction models
     - Spam detection models
5. You will create a short powerpoint presentation in addition to your deployed model to present a summary of your work.
